# ADSB-Station
ADSB-Station is a Python-based RF ground station that parses live aircraft data from dump1090. It captures and decodes ADS-B signals, extracts key flight parameters (ICAO, altitude, speed, RSSI, etc.), and outputs structured aircraft information for logging, analysis, or integration with display systems.
